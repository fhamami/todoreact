/*index.css: Wait, what do we need index.css for if we already have App.css? Remember we said App.css was for the styling of the app? That’s actually not very accurate. If App.js is the code for the “App” component, then App.css is actually the code for styling our “App” component. If you take a peek at the index.html file in the public folder, you will see there is a <div id=”root”></div> inside the body of the page. So what if I wanted to style the body of the index.html page? Or apply some type of styling that should apply to the whole page, and not just a specific component? This is what the index.css file is for. It’s worth noting that it’s optional though. If the app you are building doesn’t have any global styles, you don’t have to use it.*/
